# Adventures in Async: Part III - Master Reactive Systems using Lagom Microservices
Building reactive systems is hard. Especially when there are few examples out there. Most of them are complicated boilerplate solutions that seldom work and are difficult to extend and modify for your own use cases. While there are many options to build these kind of systems like OpenLiberty, Erlang or even bespoke solutions, itâ€™s hard to decide what will bring you a maintainable and sustainable system in terms of development skills and ROI for the firm.

This presentation demonstrated how to use the Lightbend Platform - the most operationally robust solution for deploying Reactive Microservices, adding the ability to infuse your applications with intelligence based on real-time streaming and Machine Learning (ML). It touches upon Event-First Domain Driven Design, a technique that is commonly used to build Reactive Systems.
